# My Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Training

In this training, I learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and their applications. Below you can find the topics and projects I covered during the training.

## What is Object Oriented Programming?

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm used in software development. This paradigm is based on creating objects that contain data and functions that operate on that data.

## Class and Object Concepts

Classes are templates for objects. Each class defines certain properties and behaviors. Objects are instances created from these classes.

## UML Modeling and Class Diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a language used to visually model software systems. Class diagrams are UML diagrams that show classes and the relationships between these classes.

## Class Diagram Examples

I drew various class diagrams and completed projects to reinforce the topics I learned during the training. Here are some examples:

### University Management System
I designed a system for university management and drew its class diagram.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation ensures data is hidden and only accessible from necessary places.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes that share the same interface to implement this interface in different ways.

### Abstraction

Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details and highlighting only the necessary features and behaviors.

### Zoo Management

I designed a system for zoo management and drew its class diagram.

### Flight Management System

I designed a system for managing flights and pilots and drew its class diagram.

### Online Movie System

I designed a system for an application that sells or rents movies online and drew its class diagram.

### Elevator Simulation

I designed a simulator that models the operations of elevators in a building and drew its class diagram.
